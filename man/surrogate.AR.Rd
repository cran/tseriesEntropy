\title{Surrogate Time Series Through AR Modeling (Sieve Bootstrap)}
\description{
Starting from a time series \code{x} given as input, the function generates surrogate series by means of the sieve bootstrap.
The surrogates can be used for testing for non linearity in time series.
}
\usage{
surrogate.AR(x, order.max = NULL, fit.method = c("yule-walker",
 "burg", "ols", "mle", "yw"), nsurr) 
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{a univariate numeric time series object or a numeric vector.}
  \item{order.max}{maximum order of the AR model to fit. Passed to \code{\link{ar}}}.
  \item{fit.method}{character string giving the method used to fit the AR model. It is passed to \code{\link{ar}} and
  has to be one of the strings in the default argument (partial matching works). Defaults to "yule-walker".}
  \item{nsurr}{number of surrogates.}
}
\details{
Let \code{N} be the length of the series \code{x}. The best AR model is chosen by means of the AIC criterion. The residuals of the model are
resampled with replacement. Surrogate series are obtained by driving the fitted model with the resampled residuals.
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:
    \item{surr}{a matrix with \code{N} rows and \code{nsurr} columns, in each column is stored a surrogate.}
    \item{call}{contains the call to the routine.}
