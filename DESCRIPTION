Description: Implements an Entropy measure of dependence based on the Bhattacharya-Hellinger-Matusita distance. Can be used as a (nonlinear) autocorrelation/crosscorrelation function for continuous and categorical time series. The package includes tests for serial dependence and nonlinearity based on it. Some routines have a parallel version that can be used in a multicore/cluster environment. The package makes use of S4 classes.
