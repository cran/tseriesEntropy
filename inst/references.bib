A framework for this problem is constructed and used to derive an alternative method of cross-validation, based on integrated squared error, recently also proposed by Rudemo (1982). Hall (1983) has established the consistency and asymptotic optimality of the new method. For small and moderate sized samples, the performances of the two methods of cross-validation are compared on simulated data and specific examples.}",
